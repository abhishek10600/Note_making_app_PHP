# Note_making_app_PHP
I have created a note making app using HTML, CSS, javaScript, PHP and SQL . This app is able to perform CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) . In this app you can add your note and then that note is saved in the database . You can retrieve that note from the database and read it . You can also edit that note and you can delete that note .
